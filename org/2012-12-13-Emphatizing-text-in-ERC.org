#+TITLE: Emphatizing text in ERC
#+KEYWORDS: emacs, emacs-lisp, erc, irc

I have realized [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html][ERC]] supports control characters to emphatize text
as *bold*, _underline_...  However, I prefer =*foo*=, =/bar/= and
=_foobar_= syntax, just like org-mode and Gnus. So I have added the
following code to my .emacs to do the job:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun erc-emphatize ()
    (when (eq erc-interpret-controls-p t)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "\\(?:^\\|\\s-\\)\\(\\*\\([^*]+\\)\\*\\)\\(:?$\\|\\s-\\)" nil t)
        (replace-match "\C-b\\2\C-o" nil nil nil 1))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "\\(?:^\\|\\s-\\)\\(_\\([^_]+\\)_\\)\\(?:$\\|\\s-\\)" nil t)
        (replace-match "\C-_\\2\C-O" nil nil nil 1))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "\\(?:^\\|\\s-\\)\\(/\\([^/]+\\)/\\)\\(?:$\\|\\s-\\)" nil t)
        (replace-match "\C-V\\2\C-O" nil nil nil 1))))

  (add-hook 'erc-send-pre-hook
            (lambda (string)
              (with-temp-buffer
                (insert string)
                (erc-emphatize)
                (setq str (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max))))))

  (add-hook 'erc-insert-modify-hook 'erc-emphatize)
#+END_SRC

The code transforms the text before sending it, so it will work
without changes in the IRC client of the other person, supposed
control characters is supported of course. If you want to send/receive
text literally, just disable control characters interpretation with
=C-c C-c= in the ERC buffer.
