#+TITLE: Back in action

Hello everyone. I have been away some days from the computer, but I am
back now!  I have spent two weeks in New York visiting such a great
city. I had the opportunity to attend to a LispNYC meetup and enjoy
the great atmosphere there. I hope to come back soon.

I have also a new laptop. Finally, I have to say, as I inherited the
last one from my brother and I have been using it for 6 years. Most of
the time it was good enough but it is becoming very annoying. For
example, I could not compile SBCL because it was restarted due to
overheating..

I feel like doing things now so I wish I could tell you new adventures
soon.
