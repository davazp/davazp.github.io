<p>Hello everyone. I have been away some days from the computer, but I am
back now!  I have spent two weeks in New York visiting such a great
city. I had the opportunity to attend to a LispNYC meetup and enjoy
the great atmosphere there. I hope to come back soon.

I have also a new laptop. Finally, I have to say, as I inherited the
last one from my brother I have been using my last laptop for 6
years. Most of the time it was good enough but it is becoming very
annoying. For example, I could not compile SBCL because it was
restarted due to overheating..

<p>
I feel like doing things now so I wish I could tell you new adventures
soon.
