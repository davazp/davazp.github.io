<p>Hello everybody. Here it is, a new github-hosted blog. You can know
something
<a href="/about.html">about me</a>
now, but what will this blog be about? Unsurprisingly, I will tell
different things I hack, as the main reason to open this blog is
because I do not know many people to talk about this kind of things
face-to-face. You will find some Lisp and Emacs-related posts
probably, as well as some light math, but I will post anything I find
interesting.
</p>
<p>
The blog is quite simple. I do not provide tags yet, but I have
enabled comments on the posts, so you can give some feedback.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I hope to share some nice things, and somebody likes
it. Also, English is not my mother tongue, so writing it requires some
extra effort, but I will do my best.
</p>
<p>
Welcome to my blog.
