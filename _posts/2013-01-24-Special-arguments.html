<p>I have learnt a new trick these days. Did you know that you can
declare an argument as a special variable? Quoting <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_daa.htm">Hyperspec</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Each required parameter is specified by a parameter variable var. var
is bound as a lexical variable <i>unless it is declared special</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
It seems to work also for optional and keyword arguments, but
Hyperspec does not mention it explicitly. For example, yo can do:
</p>



<pre class="example">(defvar *variable*)
(defun foo () *variable*)
(defun foobar (&amp;optional *variable*)
  (foo))
</pre>
