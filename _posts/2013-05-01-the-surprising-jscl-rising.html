title: The surprising JSCL rising

<p>I am just back from a few days of holidays and have seen how active
JSCL is!  It is really exciting.
</p>
<p>
This rising is due to <a href="https://github.com/abeaumont">abeaumont</a> probably. I stopped working, but he
came up with an idea I liked. It is, why don't integrate JSCL into
<a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a>? We would end up with a Lisp programmable browser&hellip; that's a
practical reason!  We did some tests locally and it seemed to work,
but now it is time for improving JSCL itself.
</p>
<p>
It is not the only platform where JSCL could run on. I plan to add
support for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node JS</a>. Indeed, it will let us use the REPL and tests in
the terminal in addition to the browser, which is a much more
convenient way to program.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I would like to improve the compiler a little bit.

Suggestion and patches are very welcome if you want to join us.
