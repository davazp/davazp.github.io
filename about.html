<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  My name is David Vázquez, I am a student of Mathematics, free
  software enthusiast and programmer. I was born in Spain but I live
  in Ireland right now.
</p>

<p>
  As a student of Mathematics, I love pure math.. Algebra and Topology
  mostly. I try to get an easy and intuitive comprehension of the
  abstract concepts when possible.
</p>

<p>
  As a programmer, I enjoy writing code in
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
  Lisp</a> from
  my <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU/Emacs</a>, and I
  am lucky because I have a full-time job where I do it. I also like
  other languages, but no one as much :-).
